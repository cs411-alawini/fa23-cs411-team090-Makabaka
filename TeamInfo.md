## Project Summary

The Steam Game Analytics and Recommendations Platform is a comprehensive system designed to meet the needs of the growing gaming community on the Steam platform. Our app is designed to provide users with a detailed analysis of the various games available on Steam, and users can either browse the list as a whole or sort their own search by trends, user recommendations, and different game attributes such as genre, release date, and popularity metrics. In addition, the platform will be equipped with a recommendation system to help users discover new games based on their preferences and gaming history. The project aims to enhance the gaming experience by providing a centralized platform where users can access detailed analysis and more effectively find their next favorite game.
