> Steam Game Analytics and Recommendation Platform

## Project Summary

TODO: It should be a 1-2 paragraph description of what your project is.

The Steam Game Analytics and Recommendations Platform is a comprehensive system designed to meet the needs of the growing gaming community on the Steam platform. Our app is designed to provide users with a detailed analysis of the various games available on Steam, and users can either browse the list as a whole or sort their own search by trends, user recommendations, and different game attributes such as genre, release date, and popularity metrics. In addition, the platform will be equipped with a recommendation system to help users discover new games based on their preferences and gaming history. The project aims to enhance the gaming experience by providing a centralized platform where users can access detailed analysis and more effectively find their next favorite game.

## Description

TODO: **Description** of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?

We plan to develop an integrated system, the primary goal of which is to simplify and personalize the game selection process for players, while providing developers and platform administrators with a powerful game information management tool.
The application will utilize the rich dataset available which consists of detailed information of around 13,357 games listed on the Steam platform. This dataset includes attributes such as game title, release date, genre, price, and various popularity metrics like Metacritic scores, player counts, and owner counts. 
Through this application, we can address the difficulties players face when choosing the appropriate games and offer recommendations, while also offering a centralized location to manage and update game information, ensuring that players can easily find all the information they need.

## Usefulness

TODO: Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there? If so, what are they, and how is yours different?

Our application aims to fill the gap in the market for a centralized platform offering detailed analytics and recommendations for Steam games. While platforms like Steamdb.info and steamspy.com provide data on Steam games, they do not offer an integrated recommendation system or in-depth analytics presented in a user-friendly manner. 

Our application goes beyond merely presenting data by offering users insights into game trends and a personalized recommendation system, enhancing their ability to discover new games that align with their interests. Moreover, market analysts and developers can benefit from the analytical features of the platform, gaining insights into market trends and user preferences, helping them make informed decisions in their operations.

## Realness

TODO: Describe what your data is and where you will get it.

The data for our application is sourced from publicly available Steam APIs and steamspy.com, which is a well-established platform providing data on Steam games. The dataset contains real and up-to-date information on various games listed on the Steam platform, ensuring the authenticity and realness of the data we will be utilizing for our application.

## Creative Component
