> Steam Game Analytics and Recommendation Platform

## Project Summary

TODO: It should be a 1-2 paragraph description of what your project is.

The Steam Game Analytics and Recommendation Platform is a comprehensive system developed to cater to the growing gaming community on the Steam platform. Our application aims to provide users with detailed analytics of various games available on Steam, including trends, user recommendations, and insights into different game attributes such as genre, release date, and popularity metrics. Furthermore, the platform will feature a recommendation system, helping users discover new games based on their preferences and gaming history. The project intends to enhance the gaming experience by providing a centralized platform where users can access detailed analytics and find their next favorite game more efficiently.

## Description

TODO: **Description** of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?

The application will utilize the rich dataset available which consists of detailed information of around 13,357 games listed on the Steam platform. This dataset includes attributes such as game title, release date, genre, price, and various popularity metrics like Metacritic scores, player counts, and owner counts. Leveraging this dataset, we plan to develop a web application that will offer users insights into game trends, player reviews, and detailed analytics on various game attributes.


## Usefulness

TODO: Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there? If so, what are they, and how is yours different?

Our application aims to fill the gap in the market for a centralized platform offering detailed analytics and recommendations for Steam games. While platforms like Steamdb.info and steamspy.com provide data on Steam games, they do not offer an integrated recommendation system or in-depth analytics presented in a user-friendly manner. 

Our application goes beyond merely presenting data by offering users insights into game trends and a personalized recommendation system, enhancing their ability to discover new games that align with their interests. Moreover, market analysts and developers can benefit from the analytical features of the platform, gaining insights into market trends and user preferences, helping them make informed decisions in their operations.

## Realness

TODO: Describe what your data is and where you will get it.

The data for our application is sourced from publicly available Steam APIs and steamspy.com, which is a well-established platform providing data on Steam games. The dataset contains real and up-to-date information on various games listed on the Steam platform, ensuring the authenticity and realness of the data we will be utilizing for our application.

## Creative Component

TODO: Describe a unique, innovative feature or component that can significantly enhance the functionality or appeal of the application. For instance, a community-based feature where users can create gaming communities, discuss, and share ratings.

1. **Community Integration**
   - **Forums and Discussion Boards**: Users can join community forums to discuss various game topics, share experiences, and seek advice or recommendations.

2. **Advanced Analytics and Visualization**
