    - primary key
    - e.x. `1`, `2` ..., `123`

- PlatformName
    - Now, 3 choices: Windows / Linux / Mac
- MinReqsText
    - can be NULL
- RecReqsText

### 4. DeveloperInfo

This is an entity regarding developer information, with three attributes.

    - prime key
    - e.x. `1`, `2` ..., `123`
- DeveloperName
    - e.x. `Value`
- Website
    - can be NULL

### 5. UserInfo

This is an entity regarding user login information, with four attributes.

1. **UserID**: a unique identifier to distinguish between users. This should be a string attribute and primary key for this table. NetId will serve as the username for login page.
2. UserName: a string attribute, the name of the user.
3. UserEmail: a string attribute, the email address of the user.
4. Password: a string attribute, password for login the platform.

This entity is designed according to the assumptions:
1. Every user in this platform will have a unique UserID and cannot be modified.
2. Users can change their password, which is the only allowed update operation for this entity table.
3. Once the user entered the UserName or UserEmail and Password, the system will automatically log in and to home page.

### 6. DLCInfo

This is an entity regarding DLC information, with five attributes.

1. **DLCID**: a unique identifier to distinguish between DLCs. This should be a string attribute and primary key for this table. This attribute will be generated by the system automatically.
2. QueryID: Foreign key to `GameInfo`, to identify the game which the DLC belongs to.
3. DLCName: a string attribute, the name of the DLC.
4. DLCPriceCurrency: a string attribute, the currency of the DLC price.
5. DLCPrice: an integer attribute, the price of the DLC.


## Relations

There are a total of 6 relations in our database design, which will addressed in details as follows:

### 1. Favorites

`Favorites` is a relation between `UserInfo` and `GameInfo` to mark the favorite games of each user. This is a **many-to-many** relation, for each user can have multiple favorite games, and each game can be favorited by multiple users. However, we do have restrictions based on the following assumptions:
1. One user can only favorite the same game once. This is to ensure that `UserID` and `QueryID` combined can uniquely identify a favorite record.

### 2. Comments

`Comments` is a relation between `UserInfo` and `GameInfo` to mark the comments of each user on each game. The relation has the following attributes:
1. CommentID: a unique identifier to distinguish between comments. This should be a string attribute and primary key for this table. This attribute will be generated by the system automatically.
2. CommentText: a string attribute, the content of the comment.
3. Rating: an integer attribute, the rating of the game given by the user. This should be an integer between 1 and 5.
4. CommentDate: a string attribute, the date when the comment is posted. This should be a string following the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. UserID: Foreign key to `UserInfo`, to identify the user who posted the comment.
6. QueryID: Foreign key to `GameInfo`, to identify the game which the comment is posted on.

This is a **many-to-many** relation, for each user can have multiple comments on multiple games, and each game can be commented by multiple users.


### 3. Develop

`Develop` is a relation between `DeveloperInfo` and `GameInfo` to mark the games developed by each developer. This is a **many-to-many** relation, for each developer can develop multiple games, and each game can be developed by multiple developers.

### 4. GamePlatform

`GamePlatform` is a relation between `GameInfo` and `Platform` to mark the platforms that each game supports. This is a **one-to-many** relation, for each game can support multiple platforms, with its minimum and recommended requirements for each platform. But each platform with requirements can only be supported by one game.

### 5. GameGenres

`GameGenres` is a relation between `GameInfo` and `Genres` to mark the genres that each game belongs to. This is a **one-to-one** relation.


### 6. HaveDLC

`HaveDLC` is a relation between `GameInfo` and `DLCInfo` to mark the DLCs that each game has. This is a **one-to-many** relation, for each game can have multiple DLCs, but each DLC can only belong to one game.
